This project is just a template of a candy museum. The purpose to build it was to test the new features in bootstrap 4 such as add a new breakpoint to the nav bar, the new grid system with flexbox, the display property that can be changed according to the size of the screen and so on.

Besides HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 4, JavaScript was used to change the background color of the navbar when the page is scrolled down.
